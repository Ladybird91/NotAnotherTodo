# NotAnotherTodo
North Seattle AD Program Capstone Project 2023.

NotAnotherTodo is an Android mobile application. This application is a task manager that adds an award system to create positive associations with task completions and help boost productivity. 

Our UI and design was built using Jetpack Compose and Material 3.

## Interface Design:
Designed, tested, and prototyped interface using Figma, implementing UX principles.
Utilized Material 3 and Kotlin (a UI toolkit) for creating interactive elements like dropdown menus, buttons, and UI components.
Integrated Jetpack Compose for enhanced design functionality.

## Application Development:
Developed an Android mobile application using Kotlin (a UI toolkit) as the primary programming language.
Leveraged Jetpack Compose for seamless UI development and Material 3 for an enhanced user experience.
Selected to showcase the application at The Tech Showcase at Northeastern University.

## Motivation and Task Management:
Implemented a motivation system to encourage users to complete procrastinated tasks.
Allowed users to configure tasks, categorizing them by difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and priority (low, medium, high).
Calculated task completion points based on a combination of difficulty and priority, with a hint of randomness.
