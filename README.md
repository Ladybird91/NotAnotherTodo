North Seattle AD Program Capstone Project 2023.

## About:
NotAnotherTodo is a native Android mobile task manager application. Designed and prototyped tested using ***Figma***. Developed using ***Kotlin***, ***Jetpack Compose*** and ***Material 3***.

To boost user's motivation and productivity, we've implemented a points based prize system. User's build up dynamically assigned points based on a completed task's difficulty and priority. 
We created this app as a solution to the common issue of task procrastination. Our goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to manage their tasks while introducing gamification elements to incentivize task completion.

## Key Features:

- Create and group tasks based on category.
- User assigns difficulty and priority when adding tasks - the assignments dictates how many points a task will be worth.
- Earn points by completing tasks.
- Very user-friendly interface that follows UX guidelines.
- An impactful motivation system that rewards users for their achievements.
