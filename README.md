# NotAnotherTodo
North Seattle AD Program Capstone Project 2023.


## About:

NotAnotherTodo is a native Android mobile task manager application. Designed and prototyped tested using ***Figma***. Developed using ***Kotlin***, ***Jetpack Compose*** and ***Material 3***.

To boost user's motivation and productivity, we've implemented a points based prize system. User's build up dynamically assigned points based on a completed task's difficulty and priority. 
We created this app as a solution to the common issue of task procrastination. Our goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to manage their tasks while introducing gamification elements to incentivize task completion.


## Key Features:

- Create and group tasks based on category.
- User assigns difficulty and priority when adding tasks - the assignments dictates how many points a task will be worth.
- Earn points by completing tasks.
- Very user-friendly interface that follows UX guidelines.
- An impactful motivation system that rewards users for their achievements.

### Design 

UX principles that helped guide the design:
- Recognition rather than recall
  - Decided to label icons in the lower navigation bar instead of having the more aesthetic choice of just having the icons.
  - _Jacob's Law_  "User's spend most of their time on other sites"
  - Labeled icons help reduce the memory load user's need to interact with the app.
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
  - Noticed while analyzing other task management apps that many felt cluttered, leading them to be more difficult to navigate and making the experience of using them less pleasant.
  -  "Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility"
  - We created a dropdown menu with "Switches" so the user can easily choose which categories they see, so interface isn't cluttered unlike other apps that have the categorites listed at the top or listed in the sidebar.
